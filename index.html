                <p> On the DNA level there's not much to distinguish humans from our closest relatives : chimpanzees and bonobos . At stretches of DNA that line up , human and chimp sequences are well over 90 percent identical . And , for the most part , the DNA does line up at genes , there are very few genes that are either human- or chimp specific . <br><br>
                    
                    That has meant most of the focus on understanding human evolution has been on small changes that can alter the timing or level of gene activity , and thus have an effect that's not proportionate to the number of bases changed . <br> <br>But that's not to say that newly evolved genes are irrelevant to human evolution . A paper released this week looks into how a class of new genes evolved since our split with our simian relatives . After gaining some insight into how this class evolved , the team behind the work looked at one of these newly evolved genes and found that it plays a key role in building bigger brains ,</p>

                <h2>From RNA to protines</h2>

                <p>

                    Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins . The information in DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA which is then translated into a protein . If the protein's not made , then the gene doesn't do anything . But we've known for nearly 70 years that this isn't the only option . A number of genes that are transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins . Instead , the RNA performs a critical function
